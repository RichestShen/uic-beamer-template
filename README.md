## Beamer template for UIC

This is a LaTeX Beamer template crafted for University of Illinois Chicago according to the university's [style guide](https://marketing.uic.edu/marketing-toolbox/university-style-guide/).

### Quick start

You can [use this template directly on Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/uic-presentation-template/dgjbtyvtgqcg).

### Credits

This template has been derived from the Overleaf template for [SINTEF](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/sintef-presentation/jhbhdffczpnx). I have simplified the example slides and additionally, have also included a pseudocode example slide.
